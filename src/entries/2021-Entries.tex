\newentry[Cranberry Apple Cider Brewing]{1130 Brewing Cranberry Apple Cider}

\begin{my_itemize}
    \item Mixed 32oz of apple juice and 7lbs of brown sugar to a boil and held there for 5 minutes.  Added remaining 96oz * 5 of apple juice, and 96oz of cranberry juice.  Oxygenated with a wand for 5 minutes.  Pitched M2 Enoferm and Blue Tilt sensor.
    \item The tilt sensor is not showing up.  I was using a Raspberry Pi Zero, which was having trouble connecting to the tilt before so I switched to a Raspberry Pi 3.  Still not making a connection to the tilt sensor.  I will continue to monitor, but if the battery is dead, I will watch the airlock and let it ferment for two months before racking as I do not want to recover it and risk an infection, and I cannot pitch in my other sensor as I will be brewing beer soon and will need it for that.
\end{my_itemize}
