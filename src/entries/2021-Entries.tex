\newentry[Cranberry Apple Cider Brewing]{1130 Brewing Cranberry Apple Cider}

\begin{my_itemize}
    \item Mixed 32oz of apple juice and 7lbs of brown sugar to a boil and held there for 5 minutes.  Added remaining 96oz * 5 of apple juice, and 96oz of cranberry juice.  Oxygenated with a wand for 5 minutes.  Pitched M2 Enoferm and Blue Tilt sensor.
    \item The tilt sensor is not showing up.  I was using a Raspberry Pi Zero, which was having trouble connecting to the tilt before so I switched to a Raspberry Pi 3.  Still not making a connection to the tilt sensor.  I will continue to monitor, but if the battery is dead, I will watch the airlock and let it ferment for two months before racking as I do not want to recover it and risk an infection, and I cannot pitch in my other sensor as I will be brewing beer soon and will need it for that.
\end{my_itemize}

\newentry[Tilt Sensor Batter Change]{2000 Tilt Sensor Batter Change}

The Blue tilt sensor is not reading which is likely due to a dead battery.  I sanitized a set of thongs, and opened the fermenter and removed the sensor.  Replaced the batteries in both the blue and black tilt.  It was very difficult to get the lid off the Blue sensor.  It was accomplisehed by wrapping the lid in several layers of paper towels and using a pipe wrench.  The black tilt sensor lid came off with little effort.  Both were calibrated SG in water.
