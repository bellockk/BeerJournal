\begin{my_itemize}
    \item Racked the cider.  As it was 5 gallon jugs, plus 8 lbs of brown sugar, there was more than could fit in a 5 gallon corny keg.  Two notes made during the process were that when I know we are so close to 5 gallons stop the racking when there is plenty left in the fermentation bucket.  One at the end there was a lot of yeast that got sucked up into the racking cane, and two a lot of cider spouted out of the vent end of the keg making a big sticky puddle on the floor.  Next time the keg should go into a 5 gallon bucket so overflow is caught in the bucket instead of making a puddle on the floor.
